/**
 * Find a duplicate, Space Edition™ BEAST MODE
 *
 * In Find a duplicate, Space Edition™, we were given a list of integers where:
 *
 * the integers are in the range 1..n1..n
 * the list has a length of n+1n+1
 * These properties mean the list must have at least 1 duplicate. Our challenge was to find a duplicate number, while optimizing for space. We used a divide and conquer approach, iteratively cutting the list in half to find a duplicate integer in O(n\lg{n})O(nlgn) time and O(1)O(1) space (sort of a modified binary search).
 *
 * But we can actually do better. We can find a duplicate integer in O(n)O(n) time while keeping our space cost at O(1)O(1).
 *
 * This is a tricky one to derive (unless you have a strong background in graph theory), so we'll get you started:
 *
 * Imagine each item in the list as a node in a linked list. In any linked list, ↴ each node has a value and a "next" pointer. In this case:
 *
 * The value is the integer from the list.
 * The "next" pointer points to the value-eth node in the list (numbered starting from 1). For example, if our value was 3, the "next" node would be the third node.
 * Here’s a full example:
 *
 * A list [2, 3, 1, 3], so 2 is in the first position and points to 3 in the second position.
 * Notice we're using "positions" and not "indices." For this problem, we'll use the word "position" to mean something like "index," but different: indices start at 0, while positions start at 1. More rigorously: position = index + 1.
 *
 * Using this, find a duplicate integer in O(n)O(n) time while keeping our space cost at O(1)O(1).
 *
 * Drawing pictures will help a lot with this one. Grab some paper and pencil (or a whiteboard, if you have one).
 *
 * Gotchas
 * We don’t need any new data structures. Your final space cost must be O(1)O(1).
 *
 * We can do this without destroying the input.
 *
 * Breakdown
 * Here are a few sample lists. Try drawing them out as linked lists:
 *
 *   [3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 5]
 * [3, 1, 2, 2]
 * [4, 3, 1, 1, 4]
 *
 * Look for patterns. Then think about how we might use those patterns to find a duplicate number in our list.
 *
 * When a value is repeated, how will that affect the structure of our linked list?
 *
 * If two nodes have the same value, their next pointers will point to the same node!
 *
 * So if we can find a node with two incoming next pointers, we know the position of that node is a duplicate integer in our list.
 *
 * For example, if there are two 2s in our list, the node in the 2nd position will have two incoming pointers.
 *
 * A list [3, 1, 2, 2], so the 2s in the third and fourth position both point to the 1 in the second position.
 * Alright, we’re on to something. But hold on—creating a linked list would take O(n)O(n) space, and we don’t want to change our space cost from O(1)O(1).
 *
 * No problem—turns out we can just think of the list as a linked list, and traverse it without actually creating a new data structure.
 *
 * If you're stuck on figuring out how to traverse the list like a linked list, don't sweat it too much. Just use a real linked list for now, while we finish deriving the algorithm.
 *
 * Ok, so we figured out that the position of a node with multiple incoming pointers must be a duplicate. If we can find a node with multiple incoming pointers in a constant number of walks through our list, we can find a duplicate value in O(n)O(n) time.
 *
 * How can we find a node with multiple incoming pointers?
 *
 * Let's look back at those sample lists and their corresponding linked lists, which we drew out to look for patterns:
 *
 * A list [3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 5], so 3 is in the first position and points to 2 in the third position.
 * A list [3, 1, 2, 2], so 3 is in the first position and points to 2 in the third position.
 * A list [4, 3, 1, 1, 4], so 4 is in the first position and points to 1 in the fourth position.
 * Are there any patterns that might help us find a node with two incoming pointers?
 *
 * Here’s a pattern: the last node never has any incoming pointers. This makes sense—since the list has a length n + 1n+1 and all the values are nn or less, there can never be a pointer to the last position. If nn is 5, the length of the list is 6 but there can’t be a value 6 so no pointer will ever point to the 6th node. Since it has no incoming pointers, we should treat the last position in our list as the "head" (starting point) of our linked list.
 *
 * Here's another pattern: there’s never an end to our list. No pointer ever points to None. Every node has a value in the range 1..n1..n, so every node points to another node (or to itself). Since the list goes on forever, it must have a cycle (a loop). Here are the cycles in our example lists:
 *
 * The list [3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 5] has a loop where 4 in the second position points to 3 in the fourth position, which points to 2 in the third position, which points back to 4 in the second position.
 * The list [3, 1, 2, 2] has a loop where 3 in the first position points to 2 in the third position, which points to 1 in the second position, which points back to 3 in the first position.
 * The list [4, 3, 1, 1, 4] has a loop where 4 in the first position points to 1 in the fourth position, which points back to 4 in the first position.
 * Can we use these cycles to find a duplicate value?
 *
 * If we walk through our linked list, starting from the head, at some point we will enter our cycle. Try tracing that path on the example lists above. Notice anything special about the first node we hit when we enter the cycle?
 *
 * The first node in the cycle always has at least two incoming pointers!
 *
 * We're getting close to an algorithm for finding a duplicate value. How can we find the beginning of a cycle?
 *
 * Again, drawing an example is helpful here:
 *
 * A linked list with 9 nodes represented by circles and arrows, with a cycle because node 9 links back to node 6.
 * If we were traversing this list and wanted to know if we were inside a cycle, that would be pretty easy—we could just remember our current position and keep stepping ahead to see if we get to that position again.
 *
 * But our problem is a little trickier—we need to know the first node in the cycle.
 *
 * What if we knew the length of the cycle?
 *
 * If we knew the length of the cycle, we could use the “stick approach” to start at the head of the list and find the first node. We use two pointers. One pointer starts at the head of the list:
 *
 * We put a pointer above node 1, and we know the cycle has 4 steps because it uses nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.
 * Then we lay down a “stick” with the same length as the cycle, by starting the second pointer at the end. So here, for example, the second pointer is starting 4 steps ahead because the cycle has 4 steps:
 *
 * We put a second pointer above node 4 and connected it to the first pointer at node 1, forming a "stick" 4 nodes long.
 * Then we move the stick along the list by advancing the two pointers at the same speed (one node at a time).
 *
 * The "stick" advancing down the linked list, now with the first pointer at node 4 and the second pointer at node 8.
 * When the first pointer reaches the first node in the cycle, the second pointer will have circled around exactly once. The stick wraps around the cycle, and the two ends are in the same place: the start of the cycle.
 *
 * The "stick" wrapped around the cycle with both pointers on the start of the cycle, node 6. The pointers are on the same node because the cycle and stick are the same length.
 * We already know where the head of our list is (the last position in the list) so we just need the length of the cycle. How can we find the length of a cycle?
 *
 * If we can get inside the cycle, we can just remember a position and count how many steps it takes to get back to that position.
 *
 * How can we make sure we’ve gotten inside a cycle?
 *
 * Well, there has to be a cycle in our list, and at the latest, the cycle is just the last node we hit as we traverse the list from the head:
 *
 * A linked list with 7 nodes represented by circles and arrows, with a cycle because the last node links back to itself.
 * So we can just start at the head and walk nn steps. By then we'll have to be inside a cycle.
 *
 * Alright, we’ve pieced together an entire strategy to find a duplicate integer! Working backward:
 *
 * We know the position of a node with multiple incoming pointers is a duplicate in our list because the nodes that pointed to it must have the same value.
 * We find a node with multiple incoming pointers by finding the first node in a cycle.
 * We find the first node in a cycle by finding the length of the cycle and advancing two pointers: one starting at the head of the linked list, and the other starting ahead as many steps as there are steps in the cycle. The pointers will meet at the first node in the cycle.
 * We find the length of a cycle by remembering a position inside the cycle and counting the number of steps it takes to get back to that position.
 * We get inside a cycle by starting at the head and walking nn steps. We know the head of the list is at position n + 1n+1.
 * Can you implement this? And remember—we won't want to actually create a linked list. Here's how we can traverse our list as if it were a linked list. ↴
 *
 * To get inside a cycle (step E above), we identify nn, start at the head (the node in position n + 1n+1), and walk nn steps.
 *
 *   def find_duplicate(int_list):
 *     n = len(int_list) - 1
 *
 *     # STEP 1: GET INSIDE A CYCLE
 *     # Start at position n+1 and walk n steps to
 *     # find a position guaranteed to be in a cycle
 *     position_in_cycle = n + 1
 *     for _ in xrange(n):
 *         position_in_cycle = int_list[position_in_cycle - 1]
 *
 * Now we’re guaranteed to be inside a cycle. To find the cycle’s length (D), we remember the current position and step ahead until we come back to that same position, counting the number of steps.
 *
 *   def find_duplicate(int_list):
 *     n = len(int_list) - 1
 *
 *     # STEP 1: GET INSIDE A CYCLE
 *     # Start at position n+1 and walk n steps to
 *     # find a position guaranteed to be in a cycle
 *     position_in_cycle = n + 1
 *     for _ in xrange(n):
 *         position_in_cycle = int_list[position_in_cycle - 1]
 *
 *     # STEP 2: FIND THE LENGTH OF THE CYCLE
 *     # Find the length of the cycle by remembering a position in the cycle
 *     # and counting the steps it takes to get back to that position
 *     remembered_position_in_cycle = position_in_cycle
 *     current_position_in_cycle = int_list[position_in_cycle - 1]  # 1 step ahead
 *     cycle_step_count = 1
 *
 *     while current_position_in_cycle != remembered_position_in_cycle:
 *         current_position_in_cycle = int_list[current_position_in_cycle - 1]
 *         cycle_step_count += 1
 *
 * Now we have the head and the length of the cycle. We need to find the first node in the cycle (C). We set up 2 pointers: 1 at the head, and 1 ahead as many steps as there are nodes in the cycle. These two pointers form our "stick."
 *
 *   # STEP 3: FIND THE FIRST NODE OF THE CYCLE
 * # Start two pointers
 * #   (1) at position n+1
 * #   (2) ahead of position n+1 as many steps as the cycle's length
 * pointer_start = n + 1
 * pointer_ahead = n + 1
 * for _ in xrange(cycle_step_count):
 *     pointer_ahead = int_list[pointer_ahead - 1]
 *
 * Alright, we just need to find to the first node in the cycle (B), and return a duplicate value (A)!
 *
 * Solution
 * We treat the input list as a linked list like we described at the top in the problem.
 *
 * To find a duplicate integer:
 *
 * We know the position of a node with multiple incoming pointers is a duplicate in our list because the nodes that pointed to it must have the same value.
 * We find a node with multiple incoming pointers by finding the first node in a cycle.
 * We find the first node in a cycle by finding the length of the cycle and advancing two pointers: one starting at the head of the linked list, and the other starting ahead as many steps as there are nodes in the cycle. The pointers will meet at the first node in the cycle.
 * We find the length of a cycle by remembering a position inside the cycle and counting the number of steps it takes to get back to that position.
 * We get inside a cycle by starting at the head and walking nn steps. We know the head of the list is at position n + 1n+1.
 * We want to think of our list as a linked list but we don't want to actually use up all that space, so we traverse our list as if it were a linked list ↴ by converting positions to indices.
 *
 *   def find_duplicate(int_list):
 *     n = len(int_list) - 1
 *
 *     # STEP 1: GET INSIDE A CYCLE
 *     # Start at position n+1 and walk n steps to
 *     # find a position guaranteed to be in a cycle
 *     position_in_cycle = n + 1
 *     for _ in xrange(n):
 *         position_in_cycle = int_list[position_in_cycle - 1]
 *         # we subtract 1 from the current position to step ahead:
 *         # the 2nd *position* in a list is *index* 1
 *
 *     # STEP 2: FIND THE LENGTH OF THE CYCLE
 *     # Find the length of the cycle by remembering a position in the cycle
 *     # and counting the steps it takes to get back to that position
 *     remembered_position_in_cycle = position_in_cycle
 *     current_position_in_cycle = int_list[position_in_cycle - 1]  # 1 step ahead
 *     cycle_step_count = 1
 *
 *     while current_position_in_cycle != remembered_position_in_cycle:
 *         current_position_in_cycle = int_list[current_position_in_cycle - 1]
 *         cycle_step_count += 1
 *
 *     # STEP 3: FIND THE FIRST NODE OF THE CYCLE
 *     # Start two pointers
 *     #   (1) at position n+1
 *     #   (2) ahead of position n+1 as many steps as the cycle's length
 *     pointer_start = n + 1
 *     pointer_ahead = n + 1
 *     for _ in xrange(cycle_step_count):
 *         pointer_ahead = int_list[pointer_ahead - 1]
 *
 *     # Advance until the pointers are in the same position
 *     # which is the first node in the cycle
 *     while pointer_start != pointer_ahead:
 *         pointer_start = int_list[pointer_start - 1]
 *         pointer_ahead = int_list[pointer_ahead - 1]
 *
 *     # Since there are multiple values pointing to the first node
 *     # in the cycle, its position is a duplicate in our list
 *     return pointer_start
 *
 * Complexity
 * O(n)O(n) time and O(1)O(1) space.
 *
 * Our space cost is O(1)O(1) because all of our additional variables are integers, which each take constant space.
 *
 * For our runtime, we iterate over the array a constant number of times, and each iteration takes O(n)O(n) time in its worst case. So we traverse the linked list more than once, but it's still a constant number of times—about 3.
 *
 * Bonus
 * There another approach using randomized algorithms that is O(n)O(n) time and O(1)O(1) space. Can you come up with that one? (Hint: You'll want to focus on the median.)
 *
 * What We Learned
 * This one's pretty crazy. It's hard to imagine an interviewer expecting you to get all the way through this question without help.
 *
 * But just because it takes a few hints to get to the answer doesn't mean a question is "too hard." Some interviewers expect they'll have to offer a few hints.
 *
 * So if you get a hint in an interview, just relax and listen. The most impressive thing you can do is drop what you're doing, fully understand the hint, and then run with it
